# Examples

- Example 1: **Boilerplate** - A simple boilerplate template that can be used to get a basic sample library up and running. Includes the minimal XML structure needed for a functioning preset.

- Example 2: **How to Make Buttons** - Demonstrates how to use button UI elements to control sample library parameters. Shows button states, visual feedback, and triggering actions like enabling/disabling groups or changing parameters.
- Example 3: **How to Use Convolution Reverb** - Shows how to implement convolution reverb using impulse response files (.wav) to add realistic acoustic spaces to your samples. Includes examples of different room types and wet/dry mixing. Read more: https://www.decentsamples.com/2022/11/23/for-sample-creators-how-to-use-convolution-in-your-decent-sampler-presets/
- Example 4: **Wave Shaper and Wave Folder** - Demonstrates how to use the waveshaper and wavefolder effects for harmonic distortion and creative sound design. Shows different drive levels and output settings for various timbral effects.
- Example 5: **How to Code Tempo-Synced Delay** - Shows how to implement delays that synchronize with the host DAW tempo using musical time values (quarter notes, eighth notes, etc.) instead of milliseconds. Includes feedback and stereo offset controls.
- Example 6: **Working with Note Sequences** - Demonstrates the note sequence system for creating arpeggios, step sequencers, and rhythmic patterns. Shows how to trigger sequences, control playback rate, loop modes, and transpose sequences.

- Example 7: **How to Code LFOs and Envelopes** - Shows how to add modulation sources (LFOs and custom envelopes) to your instruments. Demonstrates routing modulators to various parameters like filter cutoff, volume, and pitch for dynamic, evolving sounds.

- Example 8: **Adjusting Sample Loop Parameters with Knobs** - Demonstrates how to use UI controls to dynamically adjust sample loop points (loopStart, loopEnd) in real-time. Useful for creating seamless sustaining sounds and exploring different sections of long samples.
- Example 9: **How to Use the XY Pad UI Control** - Shows how to implement and use the XY pad control for simultaneously controlling two parameters with a single gesture. Common uses include filter cutoff vs. resonance, or volume vs. pan. Read more: https://www.decentsamples.com/2024/05/29/sample-creators-heres-how-to-use-the-new-xy-pad-ui-control/
- Example 10: **How to Use Audio Buses and External Outputs** - Demonstrates the audio routing system using buses for complex signal flow. Shows how to route groups to different buses, apply per-bus effects, and send audio to external outputs for multi-channel setups. Read more: https://decentsampler-developers-guide.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topic-how-to-use-buses-and-auxiliary-outputs.html
- Example 11: **How to Use Animations** - Shows how to create animated UI elements using multi-frame image sequences. Demonstrates controlling animation playback (forward, reverse, ping-pong), frame rate, and synchronizing animations with parameter changes.
- Example 12: **MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression)** - Demonstrates how to use MPE for expressive per-note control of parameters like pitch bend, timbre, and pressure. Shows proper MPE configuration and per-note modulation routing for expressive controllers like Roli Seaboard or LinnStrument.
- Example 13: **Controlling Velocity Sensitivity** - Shows how to adjust velocity tracking for volume (amp velocity tracking) to create more or less dynamic response to playing intensity. Useful for making instruments more expressive or consistent across different playing styles.
- Example 14: **Effects** - Comprehensive demonstration of various built-in audio effects including filters (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch, peak), reverb, chorus, phaser, delay, pitch shifter, and gain. Shows parameter ranges and typical usage scenarios.
- Example 15: **How to Use Continuous Background Sounds** - Demonstrates how to create ambient layers and continuous background sounds that play independently of MIDI notes. Shows looping techniques, volume control, and mixing background elements with playable samples.
- Example 16: **Drawing with Lines and Rectangles** - Demonstrates how to use the `<rectangle>` and `<line>` UI elements for creating custom graphics and visualizations. Includes examples of static displays, dynamic binding control (moving/resizing rectangles and lines via knobs), and an artistic demonstration (Mona Lisa rendered with rectangles). Requires DecentSampler 1.15.0+.
- Example 17: **Oscillators** - Shows how to use built-in oscillators for synthesis. Includes basic waveform selection (sine, saw, square, triangle, noise), portamento/glide effects, and multi-voice oscillator setups. Demonstrates synthesizer-style sound design without requiring audio samples. Requires DecentSampler 1.15.0+.
